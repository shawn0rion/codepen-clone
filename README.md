# codepen-clone

**How I worked on this project:**

- Utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Integrated the CodeMirror library for code editing and highlighting.
- Created separate editors for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
- Combined the user's code and displayed the result in an iframe.

**How to navigate this project:**

- HTML file contains the structure, including editors, "Run" button, and output container.
- CSS file handles the styling of the application.
- JavaScript file initializes the editors, sets values, and - defines event listeners.
- Each editor has a unique ID, and the run button triggers code execution of all 3.

**Why I built the project this way:**

- Designed to provide an interactive environment for code writing and testing.
- CodeMirror library chosen for its rich features and language support.
- Separating editors allows focusing on individual code aspects.
- Use of iframe provides a sandboxed execution environment.

**If I had more time I would change this:**

- Implement user authentication for saving and sharing code snippets.
- Enhance editor features with auto-completion and error highlighting.
- Enable code sharing with shareable links.
- Improve responsiveness for various devices and screen sizes.
